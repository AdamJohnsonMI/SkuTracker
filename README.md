# InventoryManagement
Testing backend server deployment


SkuTracker, AKA InventoryManagement, is an inventory management app that allows users to track their inventory. 

The front-end was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The back-end was created with Python, Flask, and postgresql as the database.

Next steps for the project:

Back-end

1. Add product picture, hazardous, and oversized to order page. 
2. Add login/authentication
3. Forms autofilled with database info to not reset info on submit. Editing currently overwrites fields with an empty string.
4. Pick option/ship option. Maybe add a temp tab if not all items are shipped or easy re-add option.
5. Actual error messages instead of a browser unknown error. 

Front-end
1. Adding items to a tracking number should allow multiple items to be added at a time. 
2. Expiration date is missing from tracking numbers. There is no option to add it. How do I implement. Need the above to implement?
3. Add a search bar to binned items screen to search by ASIN to find bin locations. 
4. Add a sort feature to pages. 

Misc.
1. Create a walk through video
