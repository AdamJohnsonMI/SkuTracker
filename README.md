Next steps for the project:

1. Add orders functionality as show in database diagram above. Hide the ASIN management under an admin panel. Orders page should have tracking number column when viewed as well as location of ASINs in bins.
2. Add login/authentication
3. Adding to warehouse down with tracking number instead of ASIN. App should identify ASINs in tracking number and prompt for info.
4. When receiving, date received should be added automatically.
5. Search by ASIN to find bin locations. 
6. Pick option/ship option. Maybe add a temp tab if not all items are pulled.
7. Add sort feature to pages.
