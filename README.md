# InventoryManagement
Testing backend server deployment


SkuTracker, AKA InventoryManagement, is an inventory management app that allows users to track their inventory. 

The front-end was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The back-end was created with Python, Flask, and postgresql as the database.

Next steps for the project:

1. Add product picture, hazardous,oversized, and description to order page. 
2. Add login/authentication
3. Forms autofilled with database info to not reset info on submit.
4. Pick option/ship option. Maybe add a temp tab if not all items are pulled.
5. Add sort feature to pages. 
6. Actual error messages. 
7. Search by ASIN to find bin locations. 
8. Expiration date missing from tracking numbers
9. Bug in viewing tracking numbers, multiple entries


From buyer video-
1. Add tracking number from order page. Should carry over order. Add tracking number option to admin panel. (finish)
2. Able to reference orders again when adding products to a tracking number
3. Tracking number must be able to reference multiple order id's. Maybe serialize tracking numbers to allow multiple tracking numbers

Create a walk through video.
