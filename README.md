# InventoryManagement
Testing backend server deployment


SkuTracker, AKA InventoryManagement, is an inventory management app that allows users to track their inventory from submitting their ordered products, binning items in warehouse with the tracking number from the box into bin locations, creating pick lists, and user access control.

The front-end was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The back-end was created with Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL as the database.

Next steps for the project:

Misc.
1. Create a walk through video
2. Rename site to arbitrage something and research different hosting sites
3. Have image link on receiving.
4. Add preptype to users

Priority
1. Improve Front end visual appeal and structure.
2. Create order is not recognizing tabs under current code

Possible Ideas
1. Add a date picked column?
2. Pick list bin location column should identify # of locations
3. View orders header should stick with the screen while scrolling
