# InventoryManagement
Testing backend server deployment


SkuTracker, AKA InventoryManagement, is an inventory management app that allows users to track their inventory. 

The front-end was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The back-end was created with Python, Flask, and postgresql as the database.

Next steps for the project:

1. Add product picture, hazardous, and oversized to order page. 
2. Add login/authentication
3. Forms autofilled with database info to not reset info on submit. Editing currently overwrites fields with an empty string.
4. Pick option/ship option. Maybe add a temp tab if not all items are shipped or easy re-add option.
5. Add a sort feature to pages. 
6. Actual error messages instead of a browser unknown error. 
7. Add a search bar to binned items screen to search by ASIN to find bin locations. 
8. Expiration date is missing from tracking numbers. There is no option to add it.
9. Bug in viewing tracking numbers. Why are there multiple entries
10. Adding items to a tracking number should allow multiple items to be added at a time. 
11. Create a walk through video.
